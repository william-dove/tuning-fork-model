# tuning-fork-model

## Overview
This is a project I completed in my Engineering Computations class, EAS 230. The project uses the Euler-Bernoulli Cantilever Beam Theory to model a vibrating tuning fork over time in MATLAB, both analytically and numerically. 

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2023a (or compatible version)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/william-dove/tuning-fork-model.git`
2. Open `TuningForkSoln.m` in MATLAB and run.
3. Run `PlotResults.m` & `PrintResults.m` for visualized results, or view the report.


## Results
See `/docs/project-report.pdf` for detailed findings.
